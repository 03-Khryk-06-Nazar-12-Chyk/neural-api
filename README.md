# CAI NEURAL API
CAI NEURAL API is a pascal based neural network API optimized for AVX, AVX2 and AVX512 instruction sets plus
OpenCL capable devices including AMD, Intel and NVIDIA. This API has been tested under Windows and Linux.

This project is a subproject from a bigger and older project called [CAI](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cai/).

## Why Pascal?
* Compiled pascal code is super fast! This API can outperform some major APIs in some architectures.
* Pascal is easy to learn and easy to make a bug free code. You'll able to make super fast **native** code.

## Prerequisites
You need [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) development environment. If you have an OpenCL capable device, you'll need its OpenCL drivers.

## Installation
Clone this project and add the **neural** folder to your Lazarus unit search path and you are ready to go!

## Documentation
This is under construction.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Having requests accepted might be hard.
